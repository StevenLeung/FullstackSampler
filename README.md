Completed a simple demo solution.

Solution meets all of the following requirements and has a GUI using a frontend framework that works:

- Accepts two strings as input: one string is called "text" and the other is called "subtext" in this problem statement,
- Matches the subtext against the text, outputting the character positions of the beginning of each match for the subtext within the text.
- Allows multiple matches
- Allows case insensitive matching

The simple nature of this demonstration allows myself time to spend time showcasing my understanding of software development. 
A successful solution needs to satisfy ALL the requirements laid out in the demo solution.
Typically developers fail demonstrations based on the following:
- No unit tests 
- No usage of object-oriented concepts
- No naming conventions followed 
- No frontend UI
- Bad function signature
- Fails on some scenarios

Developers who present good solutions do so for the following:
- Implemented their own unit tests
- Good test coverage
- Good algorithm
- Good implementation
- Good solution structure 

Developer uses this opportunity to show ability to understand requirements, design and implement an elegant, understandable, maintainable and tested code.
